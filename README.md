[OneChunk](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/onechunk.87527/) will limit a player to only see one chunk at a time. The best way to understand this is to see a video.

## What it does

It hides blocks:

And entities:

It does not lag the server (unless there are obscene amounts of entities).

**NOTE: This does not modify the server in any way. If you toggle and up your render distance again, and you see missing chunks, do not panic. Simply relog and the chunks will revert to normal.**

## Getting started

__**This plugin requires Java 11.** There are plenty of tutorials online about this; if it doesn't work then you have the wrong version.__

Installing this plugin is just like installing any other plugin:
1. Download the jar
2. Locate the folder your server.jar is in
3. Find the plugins folder
4. Drag and drop the downloaded jar into your plugins folder and restart the server

Make sure you set your Render Distance to 2 Chunks for full effect.

## Commands
There is only one command: /oc or /onechunk.

## Usage:
```
/oc toggle - Toggle the effect for yourself
/oc toggle <player> - Toggle the effect for the given player
```
